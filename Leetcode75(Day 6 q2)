       Product of array except self

Q)Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        output = [1] * n

       
        left_product = 1
        for i in range(n):
            output[i] = left_product
            left_product *= nums[i]

       
        right_product = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            output[i] *= right_product
            right_product *= nums[i]

        return output


solution = Solution()
print(solution.productExceptSelf([1, 2, 3, 4]))       
print(solution.productExceptSelf([-1, 1, 0, -3, 3]))
