                  Reverse words in a string
Q)Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.


Solution:
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
       
        words = s.split()
        
       
        words.reverse()
        
       
        return ' '.join(words)

solution = Solution()
print(solution.reverseWords("the sky is blue"))     
print(solution.reverseWords("  hello world  "))     
print(solution.reverseWords("a good   example"))
