                        Merge Strings Alternately
Q.You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.



class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        merged = []  
        min_length = min(len(word1), len(word2))  
        
       
        for i in range(min_length):
            merged.append(word1[i])  
            merged.append(word2[i]) 
        
       
        merged.append(word1[min_length:])  
        merged.append(word2[min_length:])  
        
        return ''.join(merged)  


solution = Solution()
print(solution.mergeAlternately("abc", "pqr"))  
print(solution.mergeAlternately("ab", "pqrs"))  
print(solution.mergeAlternately("abcd", "pq"))
